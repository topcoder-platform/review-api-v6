# Gitea Workflow Setup Guide

New environment properties were added to support Gitea Workflows. These new properties are listed below:

- GITEA_TOKEN - the gitea token
- GITEA_BASE_URL - gitea base URL which will be used by generated gitea client
- GITEA_ORG - the gitea Org name
- GITEA_REPO_DEF_BRANCH - default branch name to use when creating new repositories

These new properties are added in .env.sample.

## Gitea TS Client Generation

A generated gitea typescript client is used in this app. If there are new endpoints or new changes to existing endpoints, a new gitea client can be generated by running the provided script.

The script uses "swagger-typescript-api" which should be installed in dev dependencies. Also, take note that the generated client uses Axios to handle HTTP requests. Axios is the obvious choice as this is already part of the dependencies.

To generate a new client, just run:

```bash
./generateGiteaClient.sh
```

The script uses the following information:

- URL of Swagger JSON - https://git.topcoder-dev.com/swagger.v1.json
- Output directory - ./src/shared/clients/gitea
- Filename - gitea.client.ts

Any of the information above can be modified as needed.
